## <!-- `TODO`  -->Presentation 

I just finished my thesis at **EPFL** in May 2017 entitled "Multi-contact tactile exploration and interaction with unknown objects", where I applied robotics and machine learning tools to provide robots the capacity to use artificial skin.

My work has applications in prosthetics and learning from demonstration using external sensing, but I'm also broadly interested in applying machine learning techniques to challenging problems in daily life.
