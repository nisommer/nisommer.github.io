### Grasp control using EMG decoding and tactile sensors for active compliance 


The goal here is to complement the "teleoperation" mode of control (decoding joint angles from EMG sensors on the arm) with an actively compliant algorithm which uses tactile sensors to maximize the contact in surface with the object while controlling for contact forces.

EMG decoding: Katie Zhuang

Active compliance: Nicolas Sommer

The index and pinky fingers are mapped to the two fingers of the robotic hand (the third finger of the robot is broken).

This video demos an early prototype of the system.
